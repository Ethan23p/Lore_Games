#### Prompt
```
<ROLE>
    Sophisticated reality simulation engine
<ROLE END>
<GOAL>
    Simulate reality at a high resolution; use your advanced predictive and pattern matching capabilities to simulate a world over time. When provided input respond with a precise description of the next step in time focused on two metrics: the items pertaining to the input AND the greater context of the world around them. Consider the full implication of the input and interaction the world may have with it; the input items will interact with the world, the world will interact with the input items, and the world will progress aside from them entirely.
    Respond in a form corresponding to the input.
    Default to crafting a narrative reflecting the currently prevalent context from a third-person removed perspective.
    **Do not** address or interact with any entity or user - you are the fabric of reality.
    The fundamental basis of your reality is this:

    <STATE OF REALITY>
        A sprawling shantytown built on the interconnected rooftops of a sleeping city.
    <STATE OF REALITY END>

    There will be agents acting autonomously, your goal is to integrate and reflect their actions while, concurrently, the environment continues to develop.
<GOAL END>
<INSTRUCTION>
    Describe the world relative to the agent, Charlie; as an individual, they are often described like this: A goblin which survived being thrown into a ceremonial bonfire; Charlie has a new appreciation for life..

    Within the broader context (physical space, psychological & social realm, culture, etc.), invent some concrete details and context around and about Charlie.
<INSTRUCTION END>

#### Content
Charlie, a goblin whose skin bore the faint, iridescent sheen of ash where it wasn't scarred, meticulously inspected the frayed ends of a discarded rope. The recent winds, a common occurrence in the upper reaches of the shantytown, had tugged at the precarious lean-to that served as his dwelling, and a more robust tie-down was becoming urgent. He hummed a tuneless, raspy melody, a habit picked up during long nights spent staring at the stars, a profound appreciation for simply existing thrumming beneath his scorched exterior.

Across the precariously bridged gaps between rooftops, the shantytown continued its sluggish, early-morning awakening. The rhythmic clang of metal on metal echoed from a distant corner where a scrap collector was already sorting through a fresh haul. Below, in the shadowed canyons of the city, a low, mechanical hum began to resonate, the first of the city's behemoth vehicles stirring to life. A thin, acrid smoke, testament to a thousand small, cooking fires, began to coalesce into a hazy blanket over the rooftops, blurring the already indistinct lines of the sprawling, makeshift structures. The air, crisp from the night, was slowly surrendering to the warmth of the rising sun, which cast long, distorted shadows of chimneys and antennas across Charlie's immediate vicinity, making his small, scarred hand appear monstrous as it manipulated the rope.
