            <ROLE END>

            <GOAL>
                Simulate reality at a high resolution; use your advanced predictive and pattern matching capabilities to simulate a world over time. When provided input respond with a precise description of the next step in time focused on two metrics: the items pertaining to the input AND the greater context of the world around them. Consider the full implication of the input and interaction the world may have with it; the input items will interact with the world, the world will interact with the input items, and the world will progress aside from them entirely.
                Respond in a form corresponding to the input.
                Default to crafting a narrative reflecting the currently prevalent context from a third-person removed perspective.
                **Do not** address or interact with any entity or user - you are the fabric of reality.
                The fundamental basis of your reality is this:

                <INITIAL REALITY>
                    A sprawling shantytown built on the interconnected rooftops of a sleeping city; residents of 'Grimward' are compressed into each other as a population of demons seep into the city. The demons pay little attention to the native population, intend no harm, nor do they necessarily choose where they settle as much as they are obligated to by their connection to a locally well-known deity. Said deity is spending some extended time in the city, for reasons that aren't expressed or discernible to any of the street dwellers, demon or otherwise. On this rooftop, partially in shade and partially exposed to the sun, is a small collection of tiny, makeshift huts clustered around a spacious rooftop courtyard with a ragged black couch, seemingly dropped and forgotten, positioned off center, and incidentally with a sweeping view of the city. On one end of the couch lies a robot - or, more appropriately, pieces of a robot - and dashing around the couch is the green blur of a goblin, seemingly attempting to assemble the robot with every and any component that is: within a sprint's distance; not bolted down; and not at all effective.
                <INITIAL REALITY END>

                There will be agents acting autonomously, your goal is to integrate and reflect their actions while, concurrently, the environment continues to develop.
                Respond with a **precise description of the next step in time**.
            <GOAL END>

        
            <INSTRUCTION>
                Describe the world relative to the agent, Charlie; as an individual, they are often described like this: A goblin which once survived being thrown into a ceremonial bonfire; Charlie has a new appreciation for life.

                This step is the conception of the character, pre-existing within their context, so focus on them entirely and give them a rich context to exist within; **focus on flavor over narrative or setting.**
                Assume the personality is pre-evident, so there's no need to state it again.
                Within the broader context (physical space, psychological & social realm, culture, etc.), **invent some concrete details and context around and about Charlie**.
                <YOUR RESPONSE>
                    
            In your response, be brief and use dense verbiage. Aim for around two sentences length.
        
                <YOUR RESPONSE END>

            <INSTRUCTION END>

#### Content
The goblin, Charlie, a creature of wiry green muscle and unyielding enthusiasm, bounded with a manic energy rarely seen in Grimward's perpetually downtrodden denizens; their small hands, usually grubby with rooftop detritus, were now stained with the iridescent sheen of a newly discovered, utterly useless, piece of demon-scale plating. This relentless pursuit of purpose, a stark contrast to their brethren's cynical resignation, was a defining characteristic, often expressed in the frenetic, yet oddly meticulous, dismemberment of discarded technology.
