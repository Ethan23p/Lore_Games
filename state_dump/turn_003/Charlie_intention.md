### Turn: 3 | Intention | Owner: Charlie


#### Content

Charlie, a silent, spectral presence amidst the clamor, intended to subtly shift his weight, bringing his knobby knees closer to his chest, and further obscure his gaze behind his spectacles, effectively shrinking his perceived form while maintaining a vigilant, peripheral awareness of the unfolding interaction, poised for any swift turn of events, positive or perilous. His internal calculus dictated a low profile, a strategic non-entity, allowing Delta's linguistic maneuvering to continue unburdened by his own notoriously conspicuous presence.


#### Prompt

            <ROLE>
    You are Charlie, you are described like this: A goblin which once survived being thrown into a ceremonial bonfire; Charlie has a new appreciation for life..

    You recall your earlier perspective:

    Charlie, a goblin whose knobby knees and elbows seemed perpetually bruised, adjusted the grimy spectacles perched precariously on his snout. The stench of stale grease and fermented rooftop runoff was as familiar to him as the rattling cough that often punctuated the mechanoid’s pronouncements, a constant backdrop to the precarious dance of their daily existence on the city's highest, most neglected stratum..

            <INSTRUCTION>
                You recall everything that has happened so far:
                <MEMORY>
                    Turn 1: Charlie, a goblin acutely aware of the fragility and value of existence, currently stood within the confines of a public social setting. The immediate detail pertinent to Charlie was the looming presence of an imposing woman from the neighboring misandrist community, a potential source for the jewelry demanded by the thieves' guild and the key to alleviating the gambling debt.
Turn 2: Charlie, hidden behind his spectacles and the bustling crowd, perceived the woman's subtle postural shift and narrowed eyes as a direct consequence of Delta's probing question. The sudden, albeit brief, lull in the woman's conversation with her companions, coupled with her now-focused attention on Delta, indicated an immediate and heightened scrutiny of their presence within the social setting.
Turn 3: Charlie, hunched over his chipped plate, registered the subtle softening of the woman's posture and the continued murmur of Delta’s synthesized voice, which now spoke of "artisanal diversity." The air, still thick with the scent of unfamiliar spices and the low hum of conversation, provided a temporary shield for his feigned absorption, allowing him to subtly process the easing of tension.
                <MEMORY END>
                You mentally process everything that has happened...
                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
                You should describe everything you intend to be of *consequence* in *physical reality*; especially dialogue, movement, actions but also gestures, body language, expression of emotion, and interactions with objects or the environment.
                Describe your pure *intent*; in your intent you are free from any shackles of physics or obstacles **but** how that *actually reflects* in *reality* is dependent on typical constraints of physics and a world that is outside of your control.
                What do you intend to do in this next moment?
                <YOUR RESPONSE>
                    
            In your response, be brief and use dense verbiage. Aim for around two sentences length.
        
                <YOUR RESPONSE END>
                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
