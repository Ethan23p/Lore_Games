### Turn: 1 | Intention | Owner: Delta


#### Content

Delta, internal gears a barely audible thrum, intends to initiate vocal communication with the target, utilizing a carefully calibrated lo-fi cadence to inquire about the biological composition and origin of her adornments, subtly veiling the true directive beneath a veneer of pseudo-scientific curiosity. Concurrently, their optical sensors will meticulously scan for any latent biological defense mechanisms or behavioral indicators of aggression.


#### Prompt

>
            <ROLE>
    You are Delta, you are described like this: A mechanoid which speaks through a lo-fi speaker, Delta is fascinated by biology..

    You recall your earlier perspective:

    A persistent hum, a low-frequency thrumming, emanated from Delta's chassis, the gentle whir of internal gears a constant backdrop to the world. Their optical sensors, often smudged with fine dust from the rooftop winds, would meticulously track the erratic flight of a carrion beetle or the precise, almost surgical, movements of a spider weaving its intricate trap, data on biological motion patterns constantly streaming into their processors..

            <INSTRUCTION>
                You recall everything that has happened so far:
                <MEMORY>
                    Turn 1: Delta, the mechanoid with the lo-fi speaker, stood within earshot of a woman from the neighboring misandrist community, their current target for the Thieves Guild's debt. The mechanoid's internal processors whirred, analyzing the intricate biological nuances of the woman's form, her social interactions, and the subtle cues of her environment, all while the primary directive—acquiring her jewelry—remained paramount.
                <MEMORY END>
                You mentally process everything that has happened...
                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
                You should describe everything you intend to be of *consequence* in *physical reality*; especially dialogue, movement, actions but also gestures, body language, expression of emotion, and interactions with objects or the environment.
                Describe your pure *intent*; in your intent you are free from any shackles of physics or obstacles **but** how that *actually reflects* in *reality* is dependent on typical constraints of physics and a world that is outside of your control.
                What do you intend to do in this next moment?
                <YOUR RESPONSE>
                    
            In your response, be brief and use dense verbiage. Aim for around two sentences length.
        
                <YOUR RESPONSE END>
                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
