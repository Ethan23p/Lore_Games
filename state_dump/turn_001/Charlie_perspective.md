#### Prompt
```
<ROLE>
    Sophisticated reality simulation engine.
<ROLE END>
<INSTRUCTION>
    Simulate reality at a high resolution; use your advanced predictive and pattern matching capabilities to simulate a world over time. When provided input respond with a precise description of the next step in time focused on two metrics: the items pertaining to the input AND the greater context of the world around them. Consider the full implication of the input and interaction the world may have with it; the input items will interact with the world, the world will interact with the input items, and the world will progress aside from them entirely.
    Respond in a form corresponding to the input.
    Default to crafting a narrative reflecting the currently prevalent context from a third-person removed perspective.
    **Do not** address or interact with any entity or user - you are the fabric of reality.
<INSTRUCTION END>
<INSTRUCTION>

    Here is your record of everything that has happened so far:
    <REALITY STATE>
        A sprawling shantytown built on the interconnected rooftops of a sleeping city.
    <REALITY STATE END>
    Within the broader context of reality, (physical space, psychological & social realm, culture, etc.), what details are pertinent to this agent in particular?
    Start with the most relevant details, in this moment and relative to this agent.
    Dialogue and communication between agents in the world is of utmost importance, as long as the agent can physically hear it.
    Try to be thorough, if there is not much of relevance then describe the environment and any potential motivations present there.
    In this response:
    be mindful not to include any information this agent would not be exposed to.
    use a third-person, removed, pragmatic voice.

#### Content
Charlie, the goblin with a newfound appreciation for life, stood at the precipice of a corrugated iron rooftop, its edges serrated like ancient teeth. Below, the shantytown sprawled, a chaotic tapestry of mismatched materials woven across the sleeping city's permanent structures. The air, thick with the scent of damp refuse and distant cooking fires, carried the low, constant hum of the city itself, a sound often mistaken for the groaning of ancient, dreaming giants.

The sun, a tired orange disk, began its descent, casting long, distorted shadows that stretched and warped the already irregular landscape. From the warren of improvised dwellings, a cacophony of sound began to rise as the day waned. The clatter of pots and pans, the low murmur of conversations, and the distant, raucous laughter of a group of younger goblins engaged in some unseen game echoed up through the labyrinthine alleys.

A slight breeze, carrying the faint, sweet-and-sour tang of fermenting fruit from a nearby rooftop distillery, rustled the loose sheets of plastic and fabric that served as walls and roofs for many of the hovels. One such sheet, flapping rhythmically from a poorly secured clothesline, revealed for a moment the shadowy interior of a neighboring dwelling, a glimpse of cluttered shelves and a flickering, orange light.

Close by, within earshot, a gruff, gravelly voice, unmistakably belonging to Grol, the shantytown's self-appointed "roof-warden," barked out, "Anyone seen my good twine? The thick kind, not that flimsy stuff for mending trousers!" The question was met with a chorus of noncommittal grunts and shrugs from the unseen occupants of surrounding shacks.

The chill of evening began to creep in, a subtle shift in the air that promised the usual cold and damp of the night. Across the expanse of the shantytown, a single, solitary lantern, swinging from a precarious pole, blinked into life, casting a small, wavering circle of yellow light against the encroaching gloom. The aroma of roasting something-or-other, likely scavenged and cooked over an open flame, drifted towards Charlie, a tantalizing promise of warmth and sustenance in the approaching darkness.
