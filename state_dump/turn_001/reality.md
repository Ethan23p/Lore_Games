### Turn: 1 | Final Reality

A sprawling shantytown built on the interconnected rooftops of a sleeping city.

As the sun, a tired ember, dipped further below the horizon, casting long, fractured shadows across the corrugated iron and grimy tarp, Charlie remained a silent sentinel atop his chosen roost. The hum of contentment, a quiet echo of the Pyre's warmth, resonated within him, a stark counterpoint to Grol’s distant, forgotten demand for twine. His gnarled fingers, a testament to his ordeal, rhythmically traced the smooth, worn contours of the wooden bird, a silent liturgy performed against the encroaching gloom. The single lantern, now a more defined beacon, flickered to life across the labyrinthine rooftops, casting an orange glow that momentarily pushed back the deepening violet of the sky. The complex tapestry of evening aromas – stale cooking oil, damp refuse, the faint metallic tang of the city – wove around him, a tangible embrace of the world he now held so dear. He simply *was*, a small, grateful shadow observing the slow, inexorable march of night.

Meanwhile, a short distance away, the faint static of Delta’s speaker continued its subtle counterpoint to the city’s low thrum. Its optical sensors, like a hawk’s eye, meticulously cataloged the urban decay and the tenacious biological intrusions that defied it. Having processed the abrupt shift from the verdant Sprawl to the metallic shantytown, Delta initiated its intended action. Its metallic fingers, articulated with a practiced precision, extended towards a hardy weed that defiantly pushed through a tar-coated crack in the roof. With an almost imperceptible delicacy, a small, serrated leaf was detached from the stem. The action was swift and clean, leaving the main plant structure largely undisturbed. The leaf, a vibrant speck of green against the grimy urban canvas, was then carefully retracted and secured within a designated, sealed compartment within Delta's internal storage, becoming a new data point in its ongoing, profound biological study, even amidst this unlikely, grimy setting. The faintest scent of crushed vegetation, almost immediately dispersed by the evening breeze, was the only trace of the interaction.
