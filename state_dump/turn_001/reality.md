### Turn 0

A sprawling shantytown built on the interconnected rooftops of a sleeping city; residents of 'Grimward' are compressed into each other as a population of demons seep into the city. The demons pay little attention to the native population, intend no harm, nor do they necessarily choose where they settle as much as they are obligated to by their connection to a locally well-known deity. Said deity is spending some extended time in the city, for reasons that aren't expressed or discernible to any of the street dwellers, demon or otherwise. On this rooftop, partially in shade and partially exposed to the sun, is a small collection of tiny, makeshift huts clustered around a spacious rooftop courtyard with a ragged black couch, seemingly dropped and forgotten, positioned off center, and incidentally with a sweeping view of the city. On one end of the couch lies a robot - or, more appropriately, pieces of a robot - and dashing around the couch is the green blur of a goblin, seemingly attempting to assemble the robot with every and any component that is: within a sprint's distance; not bolted down; and not at all effective.

### Turn 1

The goblin, Charlie, now imbued with a singular focus that bordered on manic, ceased their previous, haphazard collection of irrelevant detritus. Their small, wiry hands, still faintly shimmering with the iridescent dust from the demon-scale plating they had so recently discarded, moved with a newfound, if entirely self-taught, precision among the genuine components of the disassembled robot. Each scrap of metal, every wire, and all the circuit boards were scrutinized and sorted with an almost obsessive dedication, their brow furrowed in concentration, a stark contrast to their usual chaotic energy. A low, staticky hum, almost imperceptible against the distant city din, emanated from the collection of robot parts on the couch, a nascent query from the disarticulated internal gyroscopes of the robot, Delta. It registered Charlie's determined, though still fundamentally flawed, approach to reassembly, questioning the "efficacy of current... *methodology*." The larger world, meanwhile, continued its slow churn; the early morning sun, now higher in the sky, painted more of the rooftop courtyard in warm light, though the ragged black couch remained partially shaded. Below, the sprawling shantytown stirred, and the faint, almost melodic, cries of distant street vendors began to drift up from the labyrinthine alleys of Grimward.
