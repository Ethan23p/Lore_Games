### Turn 0

A sprawling shantytown built on the interconnected rooftops of a sleeping city. Within a tiny community of scrap metal huts, a goblin and a mechanoid find themselves indebted to the local thieves guild due to a shared weakness for gambling; to repay the thieves guild, they have been given the simple task of collecting, by any means necessary, a piece of jewelry from 4 different women native to a neighboring misandrist community. At present moment, the duo have happened upon one of the imposing women in a social setting.

### Turn 1

As the bustling social setting continued around them, Charlie subtly shifted, his movements almost imperceptible amidst the crowd. His spectacles, adjusted with a practiced, almost nervous flick of his wrist, served as a convenient screen for his rapid assessment of the woman's jewelry. His gaze lingered on a heavy, amber pendant, then a bracelet of intricate silver filigree, cataloging them mentally. Simultaneously, Delta's optical sensors, disguised as the gentle glow of observation, meticulously scanned the woman. They detected a slight tightening of the muscles around her jaw as Deltaâ€™s synthesized voice, a low and deliberately non-threatening frequency, smoothly inquired about the "biological composition and geological provenance" of a small, polished stone set into one of her rings. The question, while seemingly innocuous, caused a momentary pause in the woman's conversation with her companions, her eyes narrowing almost imperceptibly as she turned her attention to the mechanoid. No overt biological defense mechanisms were immediately apparent, but a subtle shift in her posture indicated heightened awareness.
