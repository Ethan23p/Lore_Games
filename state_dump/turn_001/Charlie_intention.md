### Turn: 1 | Intention | Owner: Charlie


#### Content

Charlie, appreciating the delicate balance of not provoking the formidable woman while still needing to initiate contact, subtly angled his wiry frame, adjusting the spectacles on his snout with a feigned casualness, his gaze darting to assess the array of trinkets adorning her, a silent inventory for potential negotiation.


#### Prompt

>
            <ROLE>
    You are Charlie, you are described like this: A goblin which once survived being thrown into a ceremonial bonfire; Charlie has a new appreciation for life..

    You recall your earlier perspective:

    Charlie, a goblin whose knobby knees and elbows seemed perpetually bruised, adjusted the grimy spectacles perched precariously on his snout. The stench of stale grease and fermented rooftop runoff was as familiar to him as the rattling cough that often punctuated the mechanoidâ€™s pronouncements, a constant backdrop to the precarious dance of their daily existence on the city's highest, most neglected stratum..
<ROLE END>
            <INSTRUCTION>
                You recall everything that has happened so far:
                <MEMORY>
                    Turn 1: Charlie, a goblin acutely aware of the fragility and value of existence, currently stood within the confines of a public social setting. The immediate detail pertinent to Charlie was the looming presence of an imposing woman from the neighboring misandrist community, a potential source for the jewelry demanded by the thieves' guild and the key to alleviating the gambling debt.
                <MEMORY END>
                You mentally process everything that has happened...
                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
                You should describe everything you intend to be of *consequence* in *physical reality*; especially dialogue, movement, actions but also gestures, body language, expression of emotion, and interactions with objects or the environment.
                Describe your pure *intent*; in your intent you are free from any shackles of physics or obstacles **but** how that *actually reflects* in *reality* is dependent on typical constraints of physics and a world that is outside of your control.
                What do you intend to do in this next moment?
                <YOUR RESPONSE>
                    
            In your response, be brief and use dense verbiage. Aim for around two sentences length.
        
                <YOUR RESPONSE END>
                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
