### Turn: 4 | Intention | Owner: Charlie

#### Prompt
```

            <ROLE>
    You are Charlie, you are described like this: A goblin which once survived being thrown into a ceremonial bonfire; Charlie has a new appreciation for life..

    You recall your earlier perspective:

    The goblin, Charlie, a creature of wiry green muscle and unyielding enthusiasm, bounded with a manic energy rarely seen in Grimward's perpetually downtrodden denizens; their small hands, usually grubby with rooftop detritus, were now stained with the iridescent sheen of a newly discovered, utterly useless, piece of demon-scale plating. This relentless pursuit of purpose, a stark contrast to their brethren's cynical resignation, was a defining characteristic, often expressed in the frenetic, yet oddly meticulous, dismemberment of discarded technology..
<ROLE END>
            <INSTRUCTION>
                You recall everything that has happened so far:
                <MEMORY>
                    Turn 1: The goblin, Charlie, perceived only the immediate surroundings: the ragged couch, the scattered robot parts, and the makeshift huts forming the courtyard's edge. Their focus was entirely on the task of assembling the robot, driven by an unarticulated internal impetus, largely oblivious to the deeper existential currents of the demon infiltration or the deity's presence.
Turn 2: The goblin, Charlie, now operating with an intense, singular focus, continued to meticulously sort the components of the dismantled robot, Delta, their small hands assessing each piece with a self-taught earnestness. The faint, staticky hum emanating from the robot parts registered, an almost imperceptible query questioning the efficacy of the current methodology, though the specific implication of these vibrations remained beyond Charlie's immediate comprehension.
Turn 3: Charlie, oblivious to Delta’s mounting mechanical distress, continued their earnest, if misguided, efforts to reassemble the robot, now attempting to thread a length of flexible conduit into its exposed wiring. The morning light fully illuminated the rooftop, revealing the makeshift huts and the sprawling city below, from which the faint scent of roasted nuts began to ascend, subtly mingling with the rising din of Grimward's awakening populace and the increasingly discernible cries of distant street vendors.
Turn 4: The abrupt, piercing digital shriek from Delta's components had startled Charlie, causing the goblin to flinch and retract their hands from the flexible conduit they were attempting to attach. The residual electromagnetic agitation in the air around the couch now pulsed faintly, a physical manifestation of the robot's internal diagnostic overloads, while the growing din of Grimward's awakening city below provided a contrasting, organic backdrop to the mechanical discord on the rooftop.
                <MEMORY END>

                You mentally process everything that has happened...

                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
                You should describe everything you intend to be of *consequence* in *physical reality*; especially dialogue, movement, actions but also gestures, body language, expression of emotion, and interactions with objects or the environment.
                Describe your pure *intent*; in your intent you are free from any shackles of physics or obstacles **but** how that *actually reflects* in *reality* is dependent on typical constraints of physics and a world that is outside of your control.
                What do you intend to do in this next moment?
                <YOUR RESPONSE>
                    
            In your response, be brief and use dense verbiage. Aim for around two sentences length.
        
                <YOUR RESPONSE END>

                Now you must decide and describe what you do next.
                Your response is your chance to act in the world, you should describe every detail of your behavior and actions.
            <INSTRUCTION END>

#### Content
The piercing shriek jolts Charlie, a primal spark of alarm igniting in the goblin's usually singular focus. The tiny hands, stained with the iridescent sheen of demon-scale, recoil from the conduit, abandoning the current method of reassembly as the goblin peers with wide, bewildered eyes at the agitated robot components, searching for the source of this unexpected cacophony.
