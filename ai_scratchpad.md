## this is a buffer for you, assistant, and I to use. You should frequently make todo lists here, and this is where you would show me code changes that are not confirmed yet. Specifically with code, you can remove code that you wrote in this file after we are finished using it as reference. Keep in mind most formatting that you do doesn't properly render in the CLI, so this is often the best place for long interactions
