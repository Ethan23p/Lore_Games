# Lore Games

## Overview

A framework for making simulated worlds with great dynamism & complexity by simply taking advantage of the imaginative capabilities of AI, forcing them to overlap & interact, and even be interpreted by another imaginative AI.
 Complex interaction not because it is being guided by a super-intelligent central manager but because there are various independent actors contributing outcomes to a shared world.
 A world that is dynamic to your actions not because the pieces have been engineered so but because the pieces are being independently simulated without inter-communication.
 Roleplay?
  Unpredictable narrative arcs not because a director wants tension but because you have *no way* of knowing how the existing pieces are going to react to each other.
 Wargames?
  Outcomes which may be predictive, independent of any one perspective or bias because many different ones are present.

## Conceptual Flow

The environment mediates reality: agents perceive the environment, act upon the environment, the results of which are communicated when they next perceive. The environment simulates the effect of the various intents simultaneously, taking each intent into consideration in equal parts.
